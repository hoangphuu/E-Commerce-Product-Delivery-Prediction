# E-Commerce Product Delivery Prediction

## üìå Introduction
In the fast-growing e-commerce industry, timely product delivery is a crucial factor in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates delivery times based on historical data. By analyzing order characteristics, shipment details, and logistical constraints, we can proactively identify potential delays and optimize delivery processes. The insights from this project help businesses improve logistics planning, minimize delays, and enhance the overall shopping experience for customers.

## üìä Data
- **Data Source**: Order records containing timestamps, delivery statuses, customer details, and shipping information.
- **Objective**: Predict whether a product will be delivered on time based on historical data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Key Libraries**:
  - Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
  - Scikit-learn: Machine Learning model training
  - XGBoost, Random Forest, Neural Networks: Predictive modeling

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns in delivery times, analyzing delays, and understanding influencing factors.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Basic models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
   - Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Using accuracy, precision-recall, and ROC-AUC scores to assess model effectiveness.
5. **Insights & Optimization**: Identifying key factors leading to delays and suggesting improvements in the delivery system.

## üì¢ Business Impact
- **Operational Efficiency**: Helps logistics teams optimize routing and order fulfillment strategies.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improves trust by setting realistic expectations for delivery times.
- **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes delivery delays and operational overheads.
